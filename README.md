# pH Calculator for Titration Analysis
Welcome to the pH Calculator for Titration Analysis, a personal project born during my chemistry journey at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. This project came to me when I was struggling to understand complex chemistry concepts. After struggling with all other options to understand, I set out to construct a calculator that would not only help understand these concepts but also sharpen my proficiency in algebraic and calculus programming.

<h3> Elevating Learning </h3>
The pH Mastery Calculator transcends conventional project boundaries. It's not just a calculator; it's a conduit for transformative comprehension. This project became a beacon of enlightenment, leading the way through intricate chemical landscapes while enhancing mathematical acumen.
